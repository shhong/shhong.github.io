## Research interests

I am interested in how various building blocks of neural systems work together, broadly speaking. A main focus of my research is studying how biophysical mechanisms in neurons and networks impact their functions. Neural systems typically have a large repertoire of those, which interact with each other, while the whole system should function in a certain "operating mode" that corresponds to certain information processing. This naturally raises many questions such as how we can characterize the operating mode of the whole system, how we can discover which set of the cellular mechanisms is responsible, etc. To investigate these questions, I extensively use computational modeling, a powerful tool that allows us to explore the system often far beyond the regime accessible to available experiments and also efficiently generate experimentally testable hypotheses. Building the models based on experimental data is often no simple task, and ideas from statistical learning theory have proven to be useful for overcoming difficulties in model building. I have tried to bring together the approaches to this whole range of problems and contribute to helping us understand the physical basis of neural information processing.

## Computer models and software projects

I have developed the following computer models and data analysis packages:

1. [Correlation](http://github.com/shhong/correlation) contains the simulation and analysis code used for my study about how single neuron properties affect correlation-based coding in a neural population ([reference](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/4/1413)).
2. [ImagingAnalysis](http://github.com/JihwanMyung/ImagingAnalysis) contains my variant of multi-scale spectral clustering ([reference](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/26/8900)).
3. [CSPRC](http://github.com/shhong/csprc) is an implementation of the Compressive Sensing-based method to compute a phase responsive curve from small-sized data (see [reference](http://jn.physiology.org/content/108/7/2069)).
