## Research interests

I am interested in how various building blocks of neural systems work together, broadly speaking. A main focus of my research is studying how biophysical mechanisms in neurons and networks impact their functions. Neural systems typically have a large repertoire of those mechanisms that interact with each other and this naturally raises many questions such as how we characterize an "operating mode" corresponding to certain information processing, how we would be able to discover which set of the cellular mechanisms is responsible for that operating mode, etc. To investigate these questions, I extensively use computational modeling, a powerful tool that allows us to explore the system's property often far beyond the regime accessible to current experiments and also efficiently generate experimentally testable hypotheses. However, building models based on experimental data is no simple task and the ideas of statistical learning theory turned out to be important in recent developments. I have tried to bring together the approaches to this whole range of problems and contribute to helping us understand the physical nature of neural information processing.

## Software projects

I have developed the data analysis methods that helped us finding patterns in experimental data:

1. [ImagingAnalysis](http://github.com/JihwanMyung/ImagingAnalysis) contains my variant of multi-scale spectral clustering ([reference](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/26/8900)).
2. [CSPRC](http://github.com/shhong/csprc) is an implementation of the Compressive Sensing-based method to compute a phase responsive curve from small-sized data (see [reference](http://jn.physiology.org/content/108/7/2069)).
